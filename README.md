Data Science - An Introduction with R
================

Working repository for a workshop with the University of Wisconsin's IT Academy.

This repository contains two examples.

1.  An example showing how to use twitter in the most simple case using R.  Search for a nonsense hash tag that should return 0 results, then tweet out the hash tag and search again.
2.  A (modifiable) example to search for tweets associated with two different words or hash tags, then compare the results.
