Data Science - An Introduction with R
================

Working repository for a workshop with the University of Wisconsin's IT Academy.

This repository contains two examples.

1.  An example using NBA data to introduce (very quickly) some basic ideas about ways to show data and to start to tell stories about data.
2.  Showing how to use twitter in the most simple case using R.  Search for a nonsense hash tag that should return 0 results, then tweet out the hash tag and search again.
  
Most of this workshop will not follow the examples on line, these are starting points for further data exploration.

If you are interested in finding data to explore try some of these places to start:

* [IBM's Curated Datasets](http://ibmhadoop.challengepost.com/details/data) includes links to a number of interesting datasets
